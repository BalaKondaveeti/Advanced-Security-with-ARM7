# Multi-Sensor Integrated Security System

## Project Overview
This is my third year academic project for the Embedded systems and design course. This Multi-Sensor Integrated Security System is an advanced academic project developed as part of the final year curriculum for a Bachelor's degree in Engineering. It is designed to offer a comprehensive solution for security and monitoring, utilizing a range of sensors to detect various environmental and security-related parameters. The system integrates sound, smoke, touch, and distance sensors with an ARM LPC2148 microcontroller and a SIM900 GSM module to provide real-time alerts and enhance safety measures.

## Open Invitation
Please use this project as a resource, inspiration, or foundation for further development. Whether for educational purposes, personal interest, or professional exploration, we encourage you to fork, adapt, and build upon this work.

## Hardware Requirements
- **ARM LPC2148 Microcontroller:** Central processing unit for managing sensor data and communications.
- **SIM900 GSM Module:** Enables SMS alerts for real-time notifications.
- **KY-038 Microphone Sound Sensor:** Detects sound levels indicative of disturbances or unauthorized entry.
- **MQ-2 Gas/Smoke Sensor:** Monitors the presence of harmful gases or smoke, signaling potential fire hazards.
- **TTP223 Capacitive Touch Sensor:** Senses touch or physical interaction for access control and intrusion detection.
- **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor:** Measures distances or proximity to objects, useful for detecting presence or movement.

## Software Requirements
The development and programming of this system require an IDE that supports ARM microcontroller development, such as Keil ÂµVision, along with a suitable compiler and debugging tools.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine, set up your development environment for the ARM LPC2148 microcontroller, and explore the provided code and documentation. The project is structured for easy understanding, with separate modules for each sensor and the main application logic.
